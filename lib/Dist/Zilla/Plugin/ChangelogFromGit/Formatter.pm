=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ChangelogFromGit::Formatter - Role for formatters

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your implementation:

    package My::Formatter;
    use Moose;

    with 'Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ChangelogFromGit::Formatter';

    sub format {
        my ($self, $releases) = @_;

    	my $changelog = '';

    	foreach my $release (@{ $releases }) {

            # Don't output empty versions.
            next if $release->has_no_changes;

            # Append something to $changelog from $release

    	    foreach my $change (@{ $release->changes }) {
	            # Append something to $changelog from $change
    	    }
    	}

        # This string will be output as your Changelog.
    	return $changelog;
    }

    __PACKAGE__->meta->make_immutable;
    no Moose;
    1;

Then in your dist.ini:

    [ChangelogFromGit]
    ... other stuff
    formatter_class = +My::Formatter

Mind the +!  Note that if you name your formatter
Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ChangelogFromGit::Whatever then you can just put

    formatter_class = Formatter

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The role provides the accessors common to formatters and requires the
implementation of C<format>, which receives an arrayref of
L<Software::Release> objects in reverse chronological order.
